Several attempts have been made to measure halo assembly bias from
 observational data.
    We use a high resolution cosmological hydro-dynamical simulation
    to investigate stellar mass assembly 
    and its impact on clustering at $z=0$.
    Using the merger trees for galaxies in the range $10^{9}$\Msunh
    $\leq M_{\star} \leq 10^{11.5}$ \Msunh we first find a transition
    mass of $10^{10.5}$\Msunh that divides two 
    correlation regimes between assembly time and stellar mass.
    Above that mass, late assembly times correlate with more massive
    galaxies; below that mass late assembly correlates with less massive
galaxies.
We then quantify how, at fixed stellar mass, galaxies with an early
assembly
are more clustered than late assembly galaxies, regardless if the galaxy
is a central or a satellite.
Finally, for stellar masses below $10^{10}$ \Msunh we find 
cuts in the star-formation rate and the $(g-r)$ colour that mimic
the bias found for early/late assemblying galaxies.
These results can be used to.
Furthermore, these findings give further support to the idea that at
$z=0$  massive galaxies above $10^{10.5}$\Msunh do not show a strong
stellar mass assembly bias.

\section{Introduction}
In the Standard Cosmological Model, Lambda Cold Dark Matter
($\Lambda$CDM) the clustering properties of DM halos not only depends on their mass
but also on their assembly history.
Halos that assembly early are clustered more strongly
than halos that assembly late.
This effect is known as halo assembly bias \citep{2005MNRAS.363L..66G}.
It has been extensively shown  that
assembly bias is a robust effect
by measuring that the clustering DM halos of fixed mass depends on their formation history and internal structure \citep{2006ApJ...652...71W,2008ApJ...687...12D}.



However, the observational detection of halo assembly bias is challenging.
It requires estimating the DM halo mass and its formation history.
from galaxy observables.
This usually involves two difficult and uncertain steps.
First, implementing a grouping algorithm (to estimate the DM halo
mass). 
Second, finding good galaxy proxies to approximate the DM halo
formation history.   

This difficulty is illustrated by the following example.
\citet{Lacerna_2014} used a group catalogue based on SSDS DR4
to study DM halo masses around $\approx 10^{12}$\Msunh. 
They found that central galaxies in those groups have weak but
significant dependence of clustering amplitude with the mean stellar
age age, i.e, older galaxies had a clustering larger than younger
galaxies. This was interpreted as a detection of halo formation bias.
Later, \citet{2016ApJ...819..119L} also to studies DM halos with a
mass of $\approx 10^{12}$\Msunh. 
They used a group catalog based on SDSS DR7 data  and estimated the DM
mass estimated via lensing.
The classification into early and late forming was done using  the
inferred SFH of the central galaxies in the groups.  
They concluded that thy cannot find convincing evidence for halo
formation bias.  

Solving the difficult problem of detecting halo assembly bias from observations has been tackled with many different approaches.
An exhaustive list is beyond the reach of this introduction.
However, the following examples  help us to gauge the diversity of techniques.
\citet{2016PhRvL.116d1301M} estimated cluster masses using weak lensing and
assembly times from the average member galaxy separation to the cluster center. 
From this data they found observational evidence of halo assembly bias
for clusters of massses $1.9\times 10^{14}h^{-1}M_\odot$.
\citet{2018MNRAS.478.4487T} tried insted to quantify to what extent
galaxy assembly and halo assembly are correlated.
Based on group finding algorithms on SDSS data and matching against DM only N-body simulations,
they claim that those correlations can be detected for central
galaxies with stellar masses larger than $10^{10}$\Msunh.
More recently, \citet{2019MNRAS.485.1196Z} used Halo Occupation
Distribution (HOD) analysis to populates a DM only simulation in order
to match clustering observations from SDSS DR7. 
Although they do not provide a detection of assembly bias by directly
comparing clustering of different samples, 
the HOD model that includes galaxy assembly bias improves the fits to
the observational data. 


As a consequence of halo assembly bias, galaxy clustering properties should not only depend on
the DM halo mass but also on its formation history and internal
properties.
This influence of halo assembly bias on galaxy clustering, sometimes known as
secondary bias, has also been quantified using simulations. 
Some previous work use semi-analytic models 
\citep{2007MNRAS.374.1303C,2014ApJ...794...74J,2019MNRAS.484.1133C}
or hydrodynamical simulations
\citep{2018MNRAS.480.3978A,2020MNRAS.492.2739X,2020MNRAS.tmp.1844M}
to quantify that secondary bias. 

What those approaches have in common is that they try to anchor the
observations to a DM halo mass. 
To bypass that step \citet{2013MNRAS.433..515W} performed a detection
instead of \emph{galaxy assembly bias as a function of stellar mass}.
They used galaxy groups in SDSS DR7 to split galaxies into centrals
and satellites; not to estimate DM halo mass, simply to differentiate
these two populations.
Then, separately for centrals and satellites, they performed an additional
split by specific star formation rate (sSFR) (the proxi for the galaxy
assembly) and then measured the differences in the projected correlation function.
For central galaxies with stellar masses between $10^{9.77}$ \Msun and
$10^{11.27}$ \Msun the clustering in objects with low sSFR (early
assembly) was $20$ to $30$ percent higher than in objects with high
sSFR (late assembly); the expected results from semianalytic models
were consistently higher by $10$ to $30$ percentual points. 




The work we present here follows that perspective of directly
quantifying galaxy assembly bias.
We use the cosmological hydro-dynamical simulation IllustrisTNG simulation,
which has shown to match remarkably well the clustering properties in
observations \citep{2018MNRAS.475..676S} to report on the expected
strenght and trends with stellar mass of the galaxy assembly bias.
We measure directly the stellar mass assembly with the merger trees
and split the galaxies into early and late assembly.
We also report the differences in clustering by using cuts in colour
and specific star formation rate.


The outline of this letter is as follows, in Section \ref{sec:simul}
we describe the IllustrisTNG300-1 simulations, the construction of
galaxy sample and the method to measure their assembly.
Next, in Section \ref{sec:results}, we present the results for
clustering dependence on assembly time.
Finally, we close by discussing these results in Section \ref{sec:conclu}. 


\section{Simulated Galaxy Sample}
\label{sec:simul} % used for referring to this section from elsewhere

In this Letter we use public data from the IllustrisTNG project
\url{https://www.tng-project.org/}. 
We use the results from the simulation labeled as TNG300-1.
This simulation was performed with the AREPO code
\citep{2018MNRAS.473.4077P} that solves gravitaional and
magnetohydrodynamical physics.
The simulation also implements sub-resolution physics to describe the
processes related to star formation, black hole growth and their
associated feedback processes.
The used cosmological parameters are $\Omega_m=0.38089$,
$\Omega_b=0.0486$, $\Omega_\Lambda= 0.6911$ and $h=0.6774$ consistent
with Planck2015 \citep{2016A&A...594A..13P}. 

TNG300-1 is a simulation performed on a cubic volume
with  $205$ \Mpch on a side.
It follows the evolution of $2500^3$ DM computational particles of
mass $3.98 \times 10^7$ \Msunh.

    \label{fig:median_assembly}
\end{figure}


In the simulation the DM halos were identified using the
Friends-of-Friends (FoF) algorithm with a linking length of 0.2 times
mean interparticle separation. 
Subhalos were identified using SUBFIND algorithm
\citep{2015MNAS.449...49R}. 
We use the baryonic merger trees to estimate the assembly time for the
galaaxies.
These trees were constructed using the SUBLINK algorithm at the
subhalo level \citep{2015MNRAS.449...49R}.

We extract the main branch of the tree by following back in time the
most massive progenitor.
We use this main branch to define the assembly time as the redshift
$z_{for}$ when the galaxy in the branch has exactly half stellar mass
of its final stellar mass.  

We take as the stellar mass the measurement within
twice the stellar half mass radius of each subhalo
\citep{2018MNRAS.475..676S}.
We only use galaxies with stellar masses (at $z=0$) larger than
$10^{9}$\Msunh,   with this selection we end up with 128258 centrals
and  satellites.
This allows us to have galaxies with a well resolved formation
history.

\textbf{Cuantas particulas estelares aproximadamente tienen una
  galaxia de $10^9$ ?} 


Figure \ref{fig:stellar_fuction} shows the stellar mass functions for
this sample.
There we observe that the most massive satellite galaxy has a
mass of $10^{12}$\Msunh.  
We can also see that there are approximately $20$ central galaxies
with a similar high mass. 
In the results we are going to present next we compare centrals and
satellites. 
We impose a  minimum of $50$ galaxies in a mass bin to extract statistics. 
For this reason our results will have an upper mass limit of
$10^{11.5}$\Msunh, even though there are galaxies in the simulation
more massive than this value.

Figure \ref{fig:stellar_to_halo} shows the stellar mass as a function
of the DM halo mass of the host.
The two panels split the galaxies intro centrals and satellites. 
This shows us that centrals follow a relatively tight relationship
between stellar mass and DM halo mass.
On the other hand, satallite galaxies do not follow a clear trend.
For instance, satellite galaxies with stellar masses $\approx
10^{9}$\Msunh are hosted by halos with masses that span almost three
orders of magnitude.

Figure \ref{fig:median_assembly} summarizes the trends for the
assembly times as a function of mass for central and satellite
galaxies.
We first see that central galaxies have a systematic latter assembly
compared to satellite galaxies.
Apart from the normalization, the trends are similar for centrals and
satellites.
The treds is marked by a "transitional stellar mass" around 
$M_\star
10^{10.5}$ \Msunh.
Above that transition massive galaxies assembly late, below that
treshold more massive galaxies assembly early.

In what follows we dissect the assembly time distribution into
early/late assembly and quantify to what extend those differences are
translated into clustering.
We define early assembly as a galaxy with a formation redshift in the
first quartile of assembly time distributions; late
assembly correspond to the fourth quartile.
The formation time distribution is computed in fixed mass bins and
separately for centrals, satellites and the whole galaxy population.

To quantify the changes in galaxy clustering we estimate the relative
galaxy bias by taking the ratio of the 2-point correlation function of two
samples: 
%
\begin{equation}
b_r(r, S|A)= \frac{\xi_S(r)}{\xi_A(r)}, 
\label{eq:relative}
\end{equation}
%
where $\xi_A$ corresponds to the correlation function from a general
sample $A$ that includes all the galaxies in a fixed stellar mass bin,
while $\xi_S$ is the correlation function computed for a sub-sample,
$S$, of galaxies in $A$. 
In our case the sub-samples are built from either the first and last
quartile in the redshift assembly distribution. 
We compute the correlation function in the separation range of
$5$\Mpch\ to $10$\Mpch\ split into $10$ linearly spaced bins. 
The relative bias is computed from the median over those separation bins.
We associate an error bar to the relative bias from the standard
deviation over the same separation bins.


Figure \ref{fig:galaxy_bias} summarizes the main quantitative results
of our Letter.
There we present the relative galaxy bias as a
function of stellar mass for central, satellites, and all galaxies
separately. 
The relative bias for early assembly galaxies is higher in comparison
with the later assembly galaxies.
The clustering difference between early and late assemblying galaxies
is more pronounced towards lower masses.

Both for satellites and centrals, for masses around
$10^{9}$\Msunh\ the amplitude of the correlation function for
late/early assemblying galaxies change by a factor of two with respect
to the reference galaxy sample. 
However, as the mass increases towards $10^{10.5}$ \Msunh\ the relative
bias goes to unity.  
Above this transitional mass the error bars become so large that 
it is not possible to conclude whether the relative bias is different
between early/late assembling galaxies.  

Figure \ref{fig:comparison} provides a qualitative summary of the main
result in this Letter.
The points correspond to galaxies (centrals and satellites combined) 
within the same mass bin around $10^{10}$\Msunh. 
These galaxies are split into early (younger) and late (older)
assembly. 
Galaxies with early assembly tend to be clustered more tightly
clustered than its late-assembly counterparts.

Following Figure \ref{fig:median_assembly} one can see that most of the early
assembling galaxies should be satellites while most of the late
assembling galaxies are centrals. 
One could think that the different clustering pattern could be
explained given that one is taking a look at centrals versus
satellites. 
However, in what follows we show that the assembly/clustering trend also
holds separately for satellites and centrals.  



\section{Discussion and conclusions}
\label{sec:conclu}

In this letter we used an state-of-the-art hydro-dynamical simulation
to study how the clustering of galaxies depends on their assembly
epoch.
We performed the analysis in the mass range $10^{9}$\Msunh $\leq
M_{\star} \leq 10^{11.5}$ for the whole galaxy population and also for 
central and satellite galaxies separately.

We have showna clustering-age  dependence for central and
satellite galaxies similar to found by \citet{2005MNRAS.363L..66G}
for DM halos. 
At fixed stellar mass early-assembly galaxies tend to be more
clustered than late-assembly galaxies.
This trend is stronger towards lower stellar masses below a mass
treshold of $10^{10.5}$
\Msunh. 
Above this threshold the data does not allow to affirm whether there
is a differet clustering between early and late assembly. 


Using the two-point correlation function, we quantify the clustering
towards the relative bias defined as the equation
\ref{eq:relative}. In fig \ref{fig:galaxy_bias}, we present the
relative bias as a function of stellar mass for all, satellites, and
central galaxies separately. At fixed stellar mass older galaxies to
low stellar mass tend to be more tightly clustered than its
late-assembly counterpart according to e.g., \citep{Lacerna_2014},
\citep{2013MNRAS.433..515W}, \citep{2009MNRAS.394.2229Z}. We find that
in all cases the relative bias is higher for older galaxies and 


To conclude worth noting, that the central and satellite galaxies
evolve in different ways, however, the relationship age-clustering is
the same, i.e, older galaxies prefer overdense regions than younger
galaxies so that the galaxy properties should depend significantly on
the assembly history of their haloes, the old haloes follow the
large-scale cosmic web quite closely, while the distribution of young
haloes looks almost uniform. 


\textbf{Para discutir. Low mass clustering driven by changes in the Halo Mass}

* The effect weakens with increaing mass. Following 

* A prediction of our work is that performing the analysis on
satellite galaxies of groups should also yield a detection.
